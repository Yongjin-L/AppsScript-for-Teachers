# AppsScript-for-Teachers

**A repository of Google Apps Script examples for Google Sheets.**

This repository provides JavaScript examples designed to help teachers leverage the power of Google Apps Script within their Google Sheets.
I aim to provide useful solutions for common tasks and encourage experimentation.
Examples will be regularly updated and expanded upon.

## What's Included

Currently, the repository contains the following Apps Script examples:

*   **GPTinSheet:** 
    This script utilizes the OpenAI API (you'll need to configure your API key – instructions are included in the script) to add a custom formula called "GPT" to your spreadsheet. 
    This allows you to quickly generate text based on your data, similar to using a chatbot.
*   **Dailyquestions:**
    This is script generates daily questions based on the data present in your Google Sheet and automatically sends them to recipients via email.
    This can be useful for daily review, quizzes, or announcements.

## Intended Use & Target Audience

This repository is aimed at teachers who are looking to:

*   Automate tasks within Google Sheets.
*   Enhance their spreadsheets with advanced functionality.
*   Experiment with Google Apps Script.
*   Explore features like AI integration (via the GPTinSheet script).

## Getting Started

1.  **Open your Google Sheet:**  Navigate to the sheet where you want to use the Apps Script.
2.  **Open the Script Editor:**  In your Google Sheet, go to "Extensions" > "Apps Script".
3.  **Locate the Script:**  Find the Apps Script file you want to use (e.g., `GPTinSheet` or `Dailyquestions`).
4.  **Understand the Code:**  Carefully read the script's code to understand how it works and how to modify it for your needs.
5.  **Configure API Keys:** The scripts requires you to configure your OpenAI API key. Refer to the comments within the script for detailed instructions on setting this up.
