# AppsScript-for-Teachers

**A repository of Google Apps Script examples for Google Sheets.**

This repository provides JavaScript examples designed to help teachers leverage the power of Google Apps Script within their Google Sheets.
I aim to provide useful solutions for common tasks and encourage experimentation.
Examples will be regularly updated and expanded upon.

## What's Included

Currently, the repository contains the following Apps Script examples:

*   **GPTinSheet:** 
    This script utilizes the OpenAI API (you'll need to configure your API key â€“ instructions are included in the script) to add a custom formula called "GPT" to your spreadsheet. 
    This allows you to quickly generate text based on your data, similar to using a chatbot.
*   **Dailyquestions:**
    This is script generates daily questions based on the data present in your Google Sheet and automatically sends them to recipients via email.
    This can be useful for daily review, quizzes, or announcements.
*   **Automated Presentation Analysis with Google Apps Script**
    This topic holds two Apps scripts: CodeforSlide and CodeforSheet.
